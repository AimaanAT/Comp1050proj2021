<<Driving a car is important for people in general because it provides status and the opportunity for personal control and autonomy. 
  In sparsely populated areas, owning a car is even more important, 
  since it provides the only opportunity for travelling long distances due to a lack of public transport.
  Mitsubishi Motors is no longer planning any development of sedans, 
  meaning replacements for core models such as the aged Lancer won’t materialise for years — 
  if at all.>>
