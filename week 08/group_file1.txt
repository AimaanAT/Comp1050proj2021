Part 3

<<Aimaan Ahmad Tahsin>>
<<Once upon a time, there was a young boy named Mohamed Halloum. He was a feminine individual and strived to be the greatest average gamer. One morning, Mohamed looked in the mirror and realised how much of a  midget he really was. This made Mohamed very insecure. The next day Mohamed went to footlocked, in search of a pair of nike air max shoes which would hopefully make him taller. As he brought he pair of shoes to the checkout, a young lady approached him. "I think you are really cute". Mohamed turned around and smiled. To his suprise, the young lady was not talking to him, but a tall black man at the next register. The two continued to exchange socials as all poor Mohamed could do was watch and cry inside. He took the pair of shoes that he purchased for 300$ and went home to cry himself to sleep>>
